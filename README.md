# Techdegree Project 2: Responsive Layout

## Software Summary

I customized a web page template (provided by Team Treehouse) with my own images, text, and styling.  It is essentially a hybrid between a professional profile and a personal one.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Additional Notes

* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.  There is 1 warning for the HTML concerning the lack of a heading for the "home" section, but adding one would not correctly replicate the provided mockup.
