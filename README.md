# Responsive Layout

## Software Summary

I eyed a website mockup at different sizes (provided by Team Treehouse) and programmed it from scratch.  It is programmed as mobile-first, and then there are two media queries that adjust for screen sizes 768px and 1024px so the web page can fit mobiles phones, tablets, and laptops/desktops comfortably.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*1/4/2018*  
* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.  There is 1 warning for the HTML concerning the lack of a heading for the "home" section, but adding one would not correctly mimic the provided mockup.
* I have made only minor changes to the provided text from the mockup; most of the text is still the same.
* Occasionally, I notice that the layout at screen size 768px skews to the left or right for no apparent reason.  I have refreshed the page multiple times and tried different browsers when it happens, but it still is off-center; then, five minutes later, it centers itself and appears normally again.  Some random bug, I guess?

I'd like to thank Team Treehouse for providing another great project idea through their "Front End Web Development" techdegree.  This whole process has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me.
